This project is developed for Communications Lab II course @ University of Patras. 

## 📌 Project Description
This project creates a networked environment where multiple clients, running inside **Docker containers**, communicate bidirectionally. Using socket programming and multithreading, the system ensures efficient message exchange, including acknowledgment messages for reliable communication.

##  Features
- **Bidirectional communication** between clients.
- **Acknowledgment messages** for reliable data transmission.
- **Docker containers** to simulate networked clients.
- **Socket programming** for client-to-client communication.
- **Multithreading** for handling multiple connections.


## Technologies Used
- **Docker** 🐳 (for containerized clients)
- **Python** 🐍 (for socket programming & threading)
- **Sockets** (for network communication)
- **Multithreading** (for concurrent connections)
